# **Password Generator** #

# *Description* #

This webpage has a specific job of generating a password using multiple options for criteria that make up the password.
The user has total control over how long the password is (as long as it is within the 8-128 character limit) and the type of characters
that will be included in the password. 

Throughout this project, I faced many challenges in trying to implement certain criteria and quite a few bugs. Having booked time with 
a tutor who really simplified the basic idea of javascript I was able to implement the criteria need and got the result I was after. 
I learnt quite alot about while loops which I hadn't seen before, and also using functions which condensed my code so I didn't need to repeat 
many lines of code.
